Step 1: User Login and Authentication

The login route (/api/auth/login) verifies the userâ€™s username and password.

Use a password hashing library (like bcrypt) to safely compare passwords.

On successful login, the server generates a JWT token.

The token contains user information (like id and username) and is sent to the client.

Step 2: JWT Token

JWT (JSON Web Token) is a secure signed string created with a server secret key.

It lets the server verify that a request is coming from an authenticated user.

Tokens usually expire after a certain time (e.g., 1 hour).

Define the secret key in an environment file: JWT_SECRET=someStrongSecretKey.

Step 3: Authentication Middleware (Token Verification)

Routes that require authentication should have a middleware that:

Checks if the request contains a token in the Authorization header.

Verifies the token using the serverâ€™s secret key.

If the token is valid, allows the request to proceed.

If the token is missing or invalid, responds with 401 Unauthorized.

Step 4: Protect Content Routes

Apply the auth middleware to protected routes like /api/content.

The middleware ensures only authenticated users can access the content.

Once verified, the server fetches content from storage (in-memory or database) and returns it.

Step 5: Client-Side Handling

After login, the client receives the JWT token.

For every request to a protected route, the client sends the token in the header:

Header Name: Authorization

Format: Bearer <token>

The server validates the token before returning content.

Step 6: Database Storage (Optional)

Storage classes (like DbStorage) handle content creation, reading, updating, and deleting.

Database connection is independent of authentication.

Once a user is verified, the server fetches content from the storage and returns it.

Step 7: Summary Flow

User logs in â†’ server verifies password â†’ generates JWT â†’ sends token to client.

Client requests /api/content â†’ includes token in Authorization header.

Server verifies token â†’ if valid, returns content.

If token is missing or invalid â†’ server responds with 401 Unauthorized.

This prompt focuses only on authentication flow and content access.

It does not mention deploy-specific issues like Render service or database upload problems.

Following this will completely solve 401 Unauthorized issues conceptually.
