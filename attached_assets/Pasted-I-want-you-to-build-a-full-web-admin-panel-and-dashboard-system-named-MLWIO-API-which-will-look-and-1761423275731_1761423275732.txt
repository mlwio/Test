I want you to build a full web admin panel and dashboard system named MLWIO API,
which will look and feel exactly like the page https://blakiteapi.xyz/admin/links
 — the same theme, color palette, layout, spacing, and typography.

Below are all detailed requirements. Analyze carefully and follow exactly.

⚙️ General Setup

Use Node.js + Express for the backend.

Use MongoDB + Mongoose for the database.

Use EJS or React + Tailwind CSS for the frontend (it must visually match Blakite’s admin page).

The project must be fully deployable on Render.com (include all required configuration files).

🔐 Login Page

Username: mlwioapi

Password: MLWIO.0372

Full-page background must show my logo faded in.

Centered login box, styled with the same theme as Blakite’s page.

On successful login, redirect to /admin/dashboard.

🧭 Dashboard Page (/admin/dashboard)

The dashboard must look identical to the Blakite API admin links page — same layout, background color, fonts, card styles, spacing, and proportions.

Header (Top Bar):

Left: text → MLWIO API

Right: only one button → Upload

(❌ Remove the previous search button from the header completely.)

Footer:

Center text → Provided by MLWIO

🧩 New Section Below Header

Under the header, add a new section that includes:

A Category Selector (Movie / Anime / Web Series).

When a category is selected, only items from that category should appear on the dashboard.

A large Search button beside it.

Remove the old search button from the header entirely.

Also make the dashboard items visually improved:

Add slight gaps between each row/item.

Make all items have rounded corners on all 4 sides.

On hover (when the mouse cursor is over an item):

The card should slightly lift upward,

Change its color, and

Show a soft 3D effect (light shadow animation).

Also, at the top of the dashboard list, include the Thumbnail, Title, and Category labels (like before).

🎬 Upload Section (/admin/upload)

When the Upload button is clicked:

Go to the upload page.

The Upload button on the header changes to a Home button, which returns to the dashboard.

Upload Fields:

Name (text input)

Category (dropdown: Movie / Anime / Web Series)

If Movie is selected → show a single Drive Link input field.

If Anime / Web Series is selected →

Show a dropdown to choose the number of seasons (1–10).

Automatically generate that many season sections.

Each season section should have input fields where the user can type episode links manually.

Automatically count and label episodes (E01, E02, etc.).

Thumbnail Link input field.

🟢 When submitted:

Save the data to MongoDB.

Display it on the dashboard under its respective category (Movie / Anime / Web Series).

🔍 Search Feature

The new search button (below header) should open a small popup or inline search area:

Category selector (Movie / Anime / Web Series).

Text input to type a title.

Show matched results instantly (live search).

🧱 Dashboard Layout

Default category view: Movies.

Rows/cards should show:

Thumbnail

Title

Category

Drive link or view button

For Anime / Web Series:

Each item expands when clicked.

When expanded, show the season list and under each season, all episode links labeled automatically (e.g., S1 E01–E05).

IMPORTANT ADDITION (as requested):

The anime / season display style must be copied A-to-Z from https://blakiteapi.xyz/admin/links
 — replicate the way seasons, episode lists, numbering, expand/collapse behavior, spacing, and visual presentation exactly the same as that page. The anime/season UI should match Blakite’s implementation in all visual and interaction details.

🎨 Design & Theme

Theme must be visually identical to Blakite API’s admin links page.

Same background, colors, shadows, spacing, and button style.

Responsive for mobile devices.

Footer fixed to bottom.

Smooth hover animation with subtle 3D lift, light color transition.

Same theme continues across login, dashboard, and upload pages (MLWIO theme).

🚀 Deployment

Must be ready for Render.com deployment.

Include server.js, Procfile, and environment setup for MONGODB_URI.

Use the hardcoded login credentials above (no registration needed).
